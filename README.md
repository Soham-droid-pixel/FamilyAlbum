## 📂 About the Project

This photo album was designed as a personal creative project during my early days of learning CSS. It features:

🟦 A **colorful heading** with a personal message  
🖼️ **9 interactive image tiles** using background images and checkboxes  
🔍 A **zoom-like focus** on clicking an image – enlarging it to full screen  
🧱 A **pure CSS grid layout** with absolute positioning  
🧪 Basic **hover effects** and responsive sizing based on `vmin` units  

> ⚠️ This project is **not fully responsive** – it was made while learning CSS fundamentals and experimenting with positioning and transitions.
